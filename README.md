# Fiber_Classifier

This program uses microscopic images of fibers to accurately classify the material composition, and is progarmmed entirely in Python.

It includes a pre-trained model that can classify among nine different types of fibers, as well as the necessary tools to analyze labeled images and create new models.

Thanks to this program's method of analyzing many sub-images of the input image, the classification accuracy is well over 95%.
